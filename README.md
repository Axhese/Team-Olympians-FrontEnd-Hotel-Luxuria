# Rules for collaboration on this project:

# Avoid the use of non bootstrap styling as much as possible, unless
  a. You're not conversant with bootstrap
  b. You'd rather write your own css
  c. Most important is that you must be able to create responsive designs without bootstrap.
  
# If you must use your own stylesheets, follow these rules:
  a. Name the stylesheet thus: "ce-style.css" . Where ce are my initials, and the rest of the file name should be "-style.css"
  b. All classes and ids that are made by you should start with the same prefix system. 
    Example: ".ce-wrap-text" for a class name or "#ce-main-header" for an id.
 
# After forking and then cloning the repo, look into the file directories for appropriate places to store css, image and js assets.
# No new folders should be created. All html files should be in the base directory.

# Do not edit other people's work/pages without their express consent and even then, ensure make a commit of your files before hand.

# If you're working on the same page, discuss how work will be broken down and ensure to use comments to thoroughly seperate your work. These comments should be your name followed by a brief description of your task.

# Always give simple and appropriate explanations for each commit you make while working with git.

# For every pull request you make, explain clearly the purpose of the updates you wish for me to pull in.
# Every page will have a branch named after it. If you're more than one person working on a page, pick a leader who will first set up the file and make a pull request to me. Once i approve the PR the other person can pull in the updates from that branch (page)

# Feel free to ask me or anyone for help.

# Make sure you completely finish building your page/part before making the first pull request, any other pull request will be a correction. But avoid having too many corrections by thoroughly inspecting your work.



# These set of rules are the most important rules of all:

# Always pull in updates from the central repo before pushing to your fork.
# Always push to your fork and thoroughly test your code before making pull requests to the central repo.
# Never ever push to the central repo, instead push to your fork and make a pull request, ask me how if you want.
# Do not "git add" all files, instead always git add the particular file you are updating.

# Read these rules once again and ask me any questions
